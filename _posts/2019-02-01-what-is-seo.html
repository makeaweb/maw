<p class="lead"><b>Summary</b>: SEO stand for "search engine optimisation." Improving on your website ranking is an essential part of running an online business.</p>

<h2>Do you need SEO?</h2>

<h2>Let's visualise an example.</h2>
<p>
  We have a client that has a car servicing business in Doncaster, Melbourne. The client has told us that they want to get more people from around the local area to find them on the web. Search engine optimisation starts from the very beginning when building a website. Your domain name is your most valuable asset. For example a good domain name for our client would be carservicedoncaster.com.au. Why is this a good domain name? It is a good domain name because it includes all of the words that a customer would type to solve their problem. If the customer typed in "Car Service Doncaster" we have a greater chance to show up in the search results. This is because all of the words are highlighted in the domain name. It all starts upfront with your domain name and then cascades down to the content on your website and many other points. Such as having a website that is accessible, mobile friendly, secure and fast. 
</p>

<h2>How can you save money?</h2>
<p>
    As a customer you can save money by writing your own content. Having the knowleadge in writing good copy is a different thing and that costs money. Content that is well written and search engine optimised will help your business succeed online. So you should see it more as an investment and not a loss in financial terms. Having a copy writer or upskilling can help drastically with this. Making your website secure via https, accessible, mobile friendly and load quickly are things your most likely going to need a developer for. Using a website generator will handle some of these things for you but not at the level of accuracy a developer would be able to do. Not to mention having a developer to consult can help build idea's and solve problems. Feel free to send me a message anytime about your website and how we can improve it. Remember it all starts from how we get your customers to find you.
</p>

<h2>How we can help you</h2>
<p>
    Having a professional take you through a <a href="" target="_blank">website design process</a> will ensure you website starts with the best foot forward. 
    People are stringing together websites using generators nowadays to try and save money. 
    However most of these generators don't have the capacity or technology to handle these
    vital optimisations. You may save money using a generator but the success of your website is not guaranteed. That's why using a developer can help! We can work with you to ensure the success of your business online. Preventing the website from being another moldy website that just sits and rotes over time. Imagine a world where your customers view your website as an apple tree. They just keep coming back for more apples. That's what we are trying to achieve here. Below I have listed a bunch of optimisations that can help with the success of your website online.

<h3>Copy writing and adding fresh content</h3>

<h3>Links for other websites</h3>
<h3>Having the meta description tag on your website</h3>
<h3>Making google aware of your site structure</h3>
<h3>Use Google Search Console to help identify issues with your website</h3>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Search engine optimisation should be considered an objective in your overall marketing strategy. At the end of the day, what good is having a website if your customers can't find it on the web. At MAKE A WEB we like to keep all of this in mind when we are designing our websites. Being able to visualise the end product helps but discussing how you want your customers to find you is an integral part of any website design. This is why we will always discuss "What would a customer type into Google to find you?"
