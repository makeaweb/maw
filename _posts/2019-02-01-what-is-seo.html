<p class="lead"><b>Summary</b>: SEO stand for "search engine optimisation." Improving on your website ranking is an essential part of running an online business.</p>

<p>
  Search engine optimisation should be considered an objective in your overall marketing strategy.
  At the end of the day, what good is having a website if your customers can't find it on the web.
  At MAKE A WEB we like to keep all of this in mind when we are designing our websites.
  Being able to visualise the end product helps but also discussing how you want your customers to find you is an integral part of any website design.
  This is why we will always discuss "What would a customer type into Google to find you?"
</p>

<h3 class="h2">A real life example of SEO</h3>

<p>
  Let's visualise an example.
  We have a client that has a car servicing business in Doncaster, Melbourne.
  The client has told us that they want to get more people from around the local area to find them on the web.
  Search engine optimisation starts from the very beginning when building a website.
  Your domain name can be your most valuable assets.
  For example a good domain name for our client would be carservicedoncaster.com.au.
  Why is this a good domain name?
  It is a good domain name because it includes all of the words that a customer would type to solve their problem.
  So if the customer typed in "Car Service Doncaster" we have a greater chance to show up in the search results because all of the words are highlighted in the domain.
