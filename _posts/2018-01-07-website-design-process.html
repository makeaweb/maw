<p class="lead">Our Website design process is centered around making our customers happy and aware of what is going on during this process.</p>

<p>We first send out a Website design questionnaire. Once completed we analyse and send a Project Proposal with a Quote. If you accept we go ahead and start the project.</p>

<p>Great design is about creating a website that aligns with an overarching strategy. Well-designed websites offer much more than just a visual picture. They attract visitors and help people understand the product, company, and branding through a variety of indicators, encompassing visuals, text, and interactions. That means every element of your site needs to work towards a defined goal. A website isn’t just a business card about what you do. It needs to be part of a strategy to help your business grow. The best way to do this is to publish fresh engaging content to your customers.</p>

<h3 class="h2">Goals</h3>

<p>The goals are set out in the Project Proposal. These goals are unique to your business and created based on the answers in the Website design questionnaire.</p>

<h3 class="h2">Milestones</h3>

<h4 class="h3">Goal identification and Scope definition</h4>

<p>We are going to work together to help identify the website’s end goal. In close collaboration with you and other stakeholders if possible. For example answering questions like, who is the site for?, What is the website’s primary responsibility?, How should your site be different to your competitors? This is the most important part of any web design process. If these questions aren’t clearly answered in the brief, the whole project can set off in the wrong direction. Scope definition will help us outline a plan so that you can see realistic goals being achieved during the whole Web design process.</p>

<h4 class="h3">Wireframing</h4>

<p>During the wireframing process we will create a sitemap. This provides a foundation for any well-designed website. It will give a clear idea of the website’s information architecture. This will help explain the relationship between the various pages and content. Building a site without a sitemap is like building a house without a blueprint. Once that is complete we will collaborate together to create wireframes. Wireframes provide a framework for storing the site’s visual design and content elements. It can help identify potential challenges and gaps in the sitemap. Inevitably ensuring that we create a well designed website with a good information architecture.</p>

<h4 class="h3">Content creation</h4>

<p>Once your websites wireframe is complete you can start with another important aspect of any site: the written content. First, content engages readers and drives them to take the actions necessary to fulfill a site’s goals. This is affected by both the content itself (the writing), and how it’s presented (the typography and structural elements). Dull, lifeless, and overlong content rarely keeps visitors’ attention for long. Short, snappy, and intriguing content grabs them and gets them to click through to other pages. Even if your pages need a lot of content — and often, they do — properly “chunking” that content by breaking it up into short paragraphs supplemented by visuals can help it keep a light, engaging feel. Content also boosts a site’s visibility for search engines. The practice of creation and improving content to rank well in search is known as search engine optimisation, or SEO. Getting your keywords and keyphrases right is essential for the success of any website. My design process focuses on designing websites around SEO. Content that’s well-written, informative, and keyword-rich is more easily picked up by search engines, all of which helps to make the site easier to find.</p>

<h4 class="h3">Website development and testing</h4>

<p>Leave it to us, we now have to build the website. We will ensure that the website is tested and works in all modern devices and browsers. The website will be tested and validated in relation to the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="Go to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) website">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/about" target="_blank" title="Read about Google Page Speed">Google Pagespeed Insights</a> and on <a href="https://webaim.org/" target="_blank" title="Find out more about Web Accessibility">WAVE Web Accessibility Tool</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h3">Launch</h4>

<p>Now it’s time for everyone’s favorite part of the web design process: When everything has been thoroughly tested, and you’re happy with the site, it’s time to launch. A key thing to remember about the launch stage is that it’s nowhere near the end of the job. The beauty of the web is that it’s never finished. Once the site goes live, you can continually run user testing on new content and features, monitor analytics, and refine your messaging.</p>

<h4 class="h3">Training and consulting</h4>

<p>This will involve us training you how to update the website using the Content Management System we used to develop your website.</p>

<h4 class="h3">Online support</h4>

<p>Hosting, domain and email support. We can help you with it all. Hosting is what makes your site visible on the web. Your domain name is what makes visitors able to access your hosted website and your email is how they can contact you to get in touch.</p>

<p>You might already have a website with hosting and a domain name. In that case we can just leave it all in place and put our new designed website in its place. However this could cause problems and could already be causing problems such as site speed and performance. In order to obtain a good service we’ll have to transfer the domain name over to a new preferred hosting plan.</p>

<p>If you haven’t got a hosting, domain or an email plan setup we can do that for you too. We can buy the domain name you want to be seen at for example www.yourbusiness.com.au and an email like hello@yourbusiness.com.au.</p>
